# React Practice Project

This is my second practice project in **React**. The goal of this project is to build a clean and organized webpage using **React components**, **react-icons**. The project also includes usage of **useState hook** to re-render components dynamically.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This React project demonstrates the power of **component-based architecture**. The page is structured using reusable components such as a **Navbar**, **Header**, **Contact Form**, and **Custom Buttons**.

## âœ¨ Features

1. ðŸ“¦ Modular components for clean code organization  
2. ðŸŽ¯ Use of `useState` hook to trigger component re-renders  
3. ðŸ§© Integration of `react-icons` for icons in buttons and UI    
4. ðŸ§­ Navbar for easy navigation and layout alignment  
5. ðŸ§ª Practiced conditional styling using props (`isOutline` in buttons)
